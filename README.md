# Roll the Dice Game
This is the type of code that will interest you if you are new to JavaScript. Very informaive and takes care of all the basics in JavaScript!


## Description of the Game
1. This game which is like the traditional ```ludo game ``` basically allows the user to roll a dice that outputs a random number between 1 - 6.
2. Whenever the user rolls a new dice, the number which is rolled is added to the current score; a temporal storage of the total number of dice rolled.
3. But note that when a the user plays a 1 or rolls a 1 randomly, the user loses all his scores in the current score then the dice is given to the next player to also roll.
4. Otherwise the user can then hold the current score into thier global score.
5. The first user to exceed 20 points wins the game.
